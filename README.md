# International Student SEVIS Termination + Restoration
 
## Goal
As an international student myself, I followed the news on SEVIS terminations very closely and thought about what I could do as a journalist. Through a journalist colleague, I entered a Discord server where over a thousand international students shared their status updates and conversed about the latest developments. I got in touch with several sources from that Discord server, attempting to quantify what the students were experiencing.

## Data & Workflow
I got a survey that was sent into the Discord server by an Indian Ph.D. student, who asked for anonymity. The [survey](docs/Survey-April-12-2025.xlsx) asked students about how anxious they feel, how difficult has it been to find a lawyer, whether their SEVIS had been terminated, which country they are from, etc.
<br></br>
In my [Jupyter Notebook](/SEVIS_VISA.ipynb), I pivoted the survey data from wide format to long for Datawrapper visualization. I chose to focus on columns about finding a lawyer and anxiety.

There are more related documents and datasets in [docs](docs) that I didn't end up using. Feel free to explore those.
